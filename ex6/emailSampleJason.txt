Hi Jason,

Thank you for your email.

We would ask you to run through the following checks:
*If you run the machine, and continue holding the trigger on the machine, does the light on top of the machine flash slowly, flash fast or not flash at all?
*Does the machine make one consistent sound when in use? Or does it make a pulsing noise?
*If you remove the extension tube from the front of the machine, does the machine work as normal?
*Please remove the battery from the machine (by pressing the silver button just above where the charger plugs into the machine and pull down). Please then clean the three gold contacts on the battery with a soft dry cloth. Please then give a quick blow of air up into the handle of the machine. Reassemble and retry. Does this improve the performance?

If the machine continues to cut out, please provide the following details:
- serial number of your machine
- date of purchase
- postal address and preferred contact name and number

Best Wishes Chris
