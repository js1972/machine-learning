%NORMALEQN Computes the closed-form solution to linear regression 
%   NORMALEQN(X,y) computes the closed-form solution to linear 
%   regression using the normal equations.

theta = zeros(size(X, 2), 1);

% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: Complete the code to compute the closed form solution
%               to linear regression and put the result in theta.

% ---------------------- Sample Solution ----------------------

% I've read that its safer to typically use pinv instead of inv
% unless you really know what you're doing.

theta = pinv(X' * X) * X' * y;
